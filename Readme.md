I use this repo to track my work on Project Euler.

![Project Euler profile](https://projecteuler.net/profile/theMesh.png)

Problems will be put in directorys named 'p'x where x is the problem number.

Each problem directory shall have a task file describing the problem.

See [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) for more information.
